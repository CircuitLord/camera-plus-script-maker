# Camera Plus Script Maker
A small utility for assisting with creating and modifying camera path scripts for the Beat Saber mod Camera Plus by @xyonico.


## Installing
Put it and it's other files in: BeatSaberFolder/UserData/CameraPlus/Scripts
Note: One issue that has surfaced is the fact that the program can't write to the path files if your game install is in a system protected area, such as Program Files. I'm looking at fixing this, but until then you can move your game install to another place.
