# Camera Plus Script Maker
A small utility for assisting with creating and modifying camera path scripts for the Beat Saber mod Camera Plus by @xyonico.


## Installing
Put it and it's other files in: BeatSaberFolder/UserData/CameraPlus/Scripts

NOTE: If your game install is in a system protected area, such as "Program Files (x86)" you're going to have to either move your game install or run my tool as admin to be able to write to the path files.

## Usage
Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa5aoEF0k4E

NOTE 2: If you'd like this kind of live updating I mentioned in the video, you're welcome to use my custom build of camera plus that I made until @Brian adds his own form of live-reloading like it.

(This only works for BS 0.12.2)

All it does is whenever it detects a modified camera path in the scripts folder (if you hit apply in my program) it attempts to auto load whatever script was just saved.
