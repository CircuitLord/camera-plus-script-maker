# Camera Plus Script Maker
A small utility for assisting with creating and modifying camera path scripts for the Beat Saber mod Camera Plus by @xyonico.


## Installing
Put it and it's other files in: BeatSaberFolder/UserData/CameraPlus/Scripts

NOTE: If your game install is in a system protected area, such as "Program Files (x86)" you're going to have to either move your game install or run my tool as admin to be able to write to the path files.
